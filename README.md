# Hcs12-board-Calculator

We need to use the dragon board external keyboard and 7-segment LED to do this. The numerical values of the keypad should match the value asserted by the program. The values A, B, C and D will be used for Addition, Multiplication, Reset and Enter respectively. The calculator should be able to calculate one-digit addition and multiplication, using the keypad and display the result on the 7-segment LED. To add to this, we want to incorporate RTI (Real-Time Interrupts). This grants us the ability to alter our calculator and add functionality to time sensor the calculator and create a duration where input is enabled and then disabled.
